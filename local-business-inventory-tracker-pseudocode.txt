// As a user, I want to see a list of all available types of items.

// For each item, I want to see its name, description, price, quantity (out of 130)

// As a user, I want to be able to click on an item to see its detail page.

// As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new item to the inventory.

// As a user, I want to see how many are left out of 130 i.e. pounds of coffee beans are left in a burlap sack. A burlap sack has roughly 130 pounds.

// As a user, I want to be able to click a button to sell an item, decrementing count by 1, i.e. A pound of coffee beans. This should decrease the number of pounds left by 1. The number of pounds in a sack of coffee beans should not be able to go below 0.
